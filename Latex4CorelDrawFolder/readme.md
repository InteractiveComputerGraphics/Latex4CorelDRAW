Copy all the files in this folder to your CorelDraw 2020 installation in the addons folder.
On my PC it it here
C:\Program Files\Corel\CorelDRAW Graphics Suite 2020\Programs64\Addons\Latex4CorelDraw

There is one file with zero length `CorelDrw.addon`, which may not be present in 
this set of files (depending on how you got this).  If the file is not there
make an empty file in the above folder, with the name `CorelDrw.addon`.

The git repo is atÂ https://github.com/NelisW/Latex4CorelDRAW
