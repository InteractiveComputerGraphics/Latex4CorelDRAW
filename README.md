## Build Instructions

The included project file was made with Visual Studio 2015. You have to adapt the path of CorelDRAW in the project file Latex4CorelDraw.csproj if your CorelDRAW installation differs from "C:\Program Files\Corel\CorelDRAW Graphics Suite X8".

## Installation

1. Download the latest release and extract the zip into C:\Program Files\Corel\CorelDRAW Graphics Suite X8\Programs64\Addons to install the addon.
2. Right-click and open "Properties" for each DLL file in the folder. If you see the following text, you have to unblock the file:
"Security: This file came from another computer and might be blocked to help protect this computer."
3. Activate docker window "Latex" in the menu "Windows".
4. If you have a better solution for step 2, write me an email ;-)
